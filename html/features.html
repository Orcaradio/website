      <h2>Songfeed</h2>
	  <p>Songfeed is the first naturally evolving group playlists that allows members to add and vote on songs added to the your Feed playlist.  Users simply sign up through Facebook and begin adding friends who have downloaded the Orca Radio App.  Once friends are added, you can begin adding and voting on songs your friends have added.  It operates a lot like Facebook’s Newsfeed where your in control who’s content you see. </p>

      <h2>LIVE</h2>
	  <p>LIVE works in a very similar way to Sonfeed.  Add and vote on songs within your playlist.  Only you are not limited to the people you add but everyone in your community.  Tune into your local city or college town, choose a genre, and start voting and listening. </p>
